    	<p class="main" style="width: 490px; height:300px; border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top: 100px; text-align: center; font-size: 60px; ">
    	<br><strong>Homeworker.</strong></br></p>
       
        <p class="t1" style="background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;">I seldom go out for earning money or working. Relaxation and comfort mean a lot to me when it comes to work. As a homeworker, I have many options and have several jobs to do at the same period of time. Most of them are related to <b>art, music and food</b>.</p>
		<br>
		<p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left=0px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;">You can call me a writer, a music composer, a gourmet, a traveller, and even more. I haven't figured out an exact way to define myself yet. I guess <b>"a homeworker"</b> works just well for now. Or you may now think me as a guitar teacher or a director of a music studio, Guitaroof. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="margin-top:-351.5px; margin-left:550px; background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;">I bet lots of people wonder or maybe even hope for a career without having to suffer the stress from outside. It may be a good way to stay inside to keep away from the things that bother. But anyway, I would admit that peace inside is indeed the most important above all.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="main" style="width:491px; height:300px; margin-left: 550px;border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top:80px; text-align:center;font-size: 62px;">I was born in <strong>Guangdong, China</strong>. </p>
        <p style="margin-top:-333px;margin-left:0px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;"> I was born in Guangdong, China. I grew up and got my highschool diploma there. I have always loved my life and study experience in my hometown. My family still live there now. I think I will move back to meet with them eventually. I am independent but usually homesick.</p> 
        <p style="margin-top:45px;margin-left:0px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;"> This modern city is full of inspiring cultural perspectives. There are plentiful opportunities, such as art-related internship programs and international exchange institutions. Regardless of the excellent educational conditions here in this region, I decided to make some changes in my study life.</p> 
        <p style="margin-top:-333px;margin-left:550px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;"> With the encouragement of my family, I got the chance of going abroad to explore things related to <b>art and music</b>, which interest me the most. I got my bachelor degree in areas that I have always been into and my surprising master degree in food science, which was one of the later developed interests of mine.  </p>
        <p class="main" style="width: 490px; height:300px; border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top: 100px; text-align: center; font-size: 60px; "><br><strong>Pratt, NY</strong>.</br></p>
        <p style="margin-top:-334px;margin-left:550px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;"> After high school graduation, I came to America for bachelor and master study in the field of art and music. Five years ago, I graduated from Pratt, the Art Institute in Brooklyn, New York. Other than that, I also have earned a master degree in food science. </p>
        <p class="main" style="width:491px; height:300px; margin-left: 550px;border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top:100px; text-align:center;font-size: 62px;"><br><strong>Adventures.</strong></br></p>
        <p style="margin-top:-333px;margin-left:0px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;"> I had been exploring around for the last few years, changing my jobs for several times in the past few years. I enjoyed this kind of life style, always trying things new. But I also know that it is important to find something to stick with. Last year I finally settled down as, which I preferred to define myself as, a <b>homeworker</b>.</p>
        <p style="margin-top:45px;margin-left:0px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;"> I enjoy staying at home and keep myself away from offices or any outside workplaces. I prefer a quiet and comfortable workspace, especially where I can wear my pajamas. It is not that I do not like to go outside. Instead, I love hanging out for travel, for food, for meeting with friends, and for all other kinds of fun things. </p>
        <p style="margin-top:-334px;margin-left:550px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;">It seems that <b>adventures</b> can take place in all kinds of situations in real life. No matter what kinds of occupations you have in hand or where you are travelling or staying, <b>adventures</b> to me are all about experiencing the dynamics of personal feelings, which is not possibly to be shared with one another.</p>

        <h2>What I Did</h2>
          <img src="images/sleep.jpg" alt="sleep picture">
        <p class="main" style="width: 490px; height:300px; border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top: 100px; text-align: center; font-size: 62px; "><br><strong>Art and food</strong>.</br></p>
        <p style="margin-top:-334px;margin-left:550px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;">In the past few years, I have worked in art museums as an interior design advisor and a tour guide. Later, I got hired by local food magazines and music magazines as well, writing articles, songs or comments for them, which are the kinds of things that I have continued to do until now. </p>
        <p class="main" style="width:491px; height:300px; margin-left: 550px;border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top:100px; text-align:center;font-size: 62px;"><br><strong>The TV program</strong>.</br></p>
        <p style="margin-top:-333px;margin-left:0px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;"> I used to work in a food-related TV program in New York as one of the producers. It was the year before last year and was a wonderful experience for sure. I got to taste various delicious foods and learn a lot from expertise in the field of food science. But it was in California and I preferred to get back New York at that time.  </p>
        <p class="main" style="width: 490px; height:300px; border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top: 100px; text-align: center; font-size: 62px; "><br><strong>A change.</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-top:-334px;margin-left:550px;background-color: #9b8578; width: 430px; height: 237px; padding: 40px; text-align:center;">I then decided to change my vocation after working for the TV program for one year. Beyond location constraints, I wanted some more challenges, perhaps something new. That was when I started new <b>adventures</b> then.</p>

You can find out more information from our YouTube channel. This studio is well-known among new music composers nowadays. My colleagues and I are coming up with new ideas this coming Spring for advancement. </p>
        <p class="main" style="width:491px; height:300px; margin-left: 550px;border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top:100px; text-align:center;font-size: 62px;"><br><strong>Growing<strong>.</br></p>

It is landing on several other states as well, including Wisconsin, California, Ohio, North Carolina, Michigan and Florida. I believe that it will continue to <b>grow</b> in the following years, more rapidly. </p>
        <p class="main" style="width: 490px; height:300px; border: 2px solid #9b8578; padding: 7px; margin-top: 100px; text-align: center; font-size: 62px; "><br><b>Gathering</b>.</br></p>

It is a sort of job but has been an enjoyment in life for me, too. Through this, I hope to <b>gather</b> people who are passionate about music together.</p>
